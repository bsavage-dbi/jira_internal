# JIRA Cloud Internal Comment Extension

Sets all comment boxes in JIRA to default to "Comment Internally" instead of "Share With Customer".

## Installation

1. Download the repository to your local machine. You will need to keep the folder on your machine in order to run the extension, so avoid saving it to your Desktop or a temporary folder.
2. Open Chrome and go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/). 
3. Enable Developer Mode (if not already enabled) by selecting the "Developer mode" checkbox at the top right of the page.
4. Select "Load unpacked extension..." and navigate to this repository folder on your file system.
5. Confirm the extension is installed properly by navigating to datavorelabs.atlassian.net and opening any issue. The default comment button (highlighted in blue under the comment textarea) should be "Comment Internally" instead of "Share With Customer".
